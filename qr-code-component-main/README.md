## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### Areas of concern

My one concern in this project is my use of absolute position. I implemented this in order to make the modal center both horizontally and vertically on the screen. I am unsure if this is good practice though.

This is the code snippet:

```css
position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    margin: auto;
```
